## How to add your GSoC report

Follow these steps to add your report to this repository.

Create your folder and files

- Folder layout: place your report under the year and your GitHub username folder.
- Example structure:

```
	2025/
		<your-github-username>/
			<your-github-username>-gsoc-2025-report.md
			assets/

```

Asset/media guidelines

- Put images/videos in an assets/ subfolder next to your report.
- Prefer efficient formats: images (webp/png/jpg), videos (mp4/h264). Keep files reasonably small (<10â€“20 MB each).
